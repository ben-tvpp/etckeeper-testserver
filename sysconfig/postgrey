# Postgrey offers 2 listening types, --inet and --unix. As default, Fedora
# postgrey works under UNIX socket, but, changing to TCP socket on user's own
# is also available, for instance, let it work at 10023 port of localhost:
#   --inet=10023
# To be more detailed, there is another way if you still run it at localhost:
#   --inet=127.0.0.1:10023
POSTGREY_TYPE="--unix=/var/spool/postfix/postgrey/socket"

# If postgrey works under UNIX socket way, PID file can be specified to
# custom location, note that no need to set this if postgrey is working
# under TCP socket way.
POSTGREY_PID="--pidfile=/var/run/postgrey.pid"

# Name of group which postgrey belongs, default is postgrey
POSTGREY_GROUP="--group=postgrey"

# Name of user which postgrey belongs, default is postgrey
POSTGREY_USER="--user=postgrey"

# DELAY
POSTGREY_DELAY="--delay=60"
